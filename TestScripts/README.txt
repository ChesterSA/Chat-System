Both the scripts here do the same thing:

1) they echo back what is sent to them.
2) they also behave as a client, not as a peer as they don't accept they're own connections.

Ruby version: chat.rb

  At the command line: ruby char.rb


Python 3 version: chat.py

Instruction

You will need to provide a handle (an name) which is used as its identifier in the Java application.

As these test scripts do nothing more than echo back the messages that they're sent, there is no further interaction required after specifying the handle.

To exit, press CTRL+C.
